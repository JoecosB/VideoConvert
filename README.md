# VideoConvert
## Intro
Very strange video converter, converts .mp4 video into text and displays. Works fine on mac and linux, and perhaps windows if you use raw scripts in the ./scripts folder :^)

## Tips
Before using the converter, please make sure you've got the .mp4 file in the same folder with run.sh, or it won't work. Only one MP4 file at a time. The converted text-frames would be huge, so don't convert MP4 videos that's too big.
